ï‚· How will you compare two lists? 
-->Element-wise Comparison:
You can compare each element of the two lists using a loop or list comprehension. This method checks if the elements at corresponding positions are equal.

Using all() and zip():
You can use all() with zip() to efficiently compare all elements in two lists.
This approach also works well for lists of different lengths.

Using == Operator:
The == operator directly compares the entire lists.
This method checks if the lists have the same elements in the same order.

Choose the method that best fits your use case, considering whether you want to compare the lists element-wise, handle lists of different lengths, or check for equality in terms of both elements and order.
