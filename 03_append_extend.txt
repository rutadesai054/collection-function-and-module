Differentiate between append () and extend () methods? 
-->append() method:
The append() method is used to add a single element to the end of a list.
It takes one argument, which is the element you want to add.
The element is added as a single item to the end of the list.

-->extend() method:
The extend() method is used to append the elements of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) to the end of the list.
It takes an iterable as its argument and adds its elements to the list.
The individual elements of the iterable are added to the list, not the iterable itself.
